                    <p>The label autistic or neurodivergent doesn't mean much on its own, it is always referring to
                        people.
                        Who are we as autistic individuals and can we form a community?
                        <i>iets tekenen</i> is an invitation for autistic students, diagnosed or suspicious, to hang out
                        and draw stuff. <br>Drawing materials will be there, but you are also welcome to bring your own.
                        <br><br>

                    <p>We decided to extend the movie screenings for this week with another Palestinian reference, in
                        solidarity. This time it's Elia Suleiman’s "It Must Be Heaven”, from 2019. In which a man
                        escapes Palestine for a new beginning, only to encounter the same problems as back home.<br><br>

                        It’s a completely different mood and angle than the previous screenings we’ve had this week. But
                        we hope it adds to the understanding of the complexity of the situation now in
                        Palestine.<br><br>

                        This recommendation was made by one of our viewers from the first evening. And you can check out
                        the trailer on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8359842/">IMDB</a>.

                        The Student Union invites you tonight, 26th October, in the Cinema Room from 7PM, room BA
                        204.<br>Hopefully, see you then and there!

                    <p>Thank you for all that showed up last night for the screening of “5 Broken Cameras”! Movies are
                        always better when seen together and when they foster dialogue. And thank you for the

                        nurturing the discussion.<br><br>

                        To continue diving into the topic of the film, apartheid and colonialism, we at Student Union
                        have taken it upon ourselves to make another screening tonight in the cinema room from 7PM. Room
                        BA.204.<br><br>

                        This time we will be screening a 2014 documentary titled “Concerning violence”. The film
                        narrates the events of African nationalist and independence movements in the 1960s and 1970s
                        which challenged colonial and white minority rule.<br><br>

                        The documentary film is written and directed by Göran Olsson. It is based on Frantz Fanon's
                        essay, Concerning Violence, from his 1961 book The Wretched of the Earth.<br><br>

                        To read more about it check out <a

                        Hopefully see you then and there!
